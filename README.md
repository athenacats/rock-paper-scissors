What I struggled with most was calling the playerSelection. Turns out i did not include the swahili words in the buttons and that kept bringing undefined. How i solved it was by using console logs, though a little too late as i wasted more than 48 hours stuck, rewriting the js.
Other issue was with the buttons not being clickable. Figured out that padding-top on the lower elements blocked the buttons, so i had to play around with the positioning.
Overall, 10/10 would not recomment not using console.log . Wasted so much time, all because of language lol.
